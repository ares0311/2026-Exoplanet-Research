# PROJECT STATUS

## Status: Active Development
## Phase: Milestone 39 Complete — Physics, Vetting, Planning, and XGBoost Model Trained
## Last Updated: 2026-06-10

---

## Current Snapshot

The repository contains a reproducible TESS/Kepler exoplanet candidate toolkit with:

- Core pipeline: Fetch -> Clean -> Search -> Vet -> Score -> Classify
- Bayesian log-score model over six hypotheses
- Optional XGBoost and stacking scorer modes (Tier 1 model trained: Kepler KOI AUC=0.992)
- SQLite-backed background automation with top-level logs
- 415 standalone `Skills/` utility scripts
- 432 top-level test files, 6,385 default tests passing
- 27 package Python modules under `src/exo_toolkit/`

Local validation note: after restoring the declared `xgboost` dependency and installing the macOS OpenMP runtime (`libomp`), the default test suite passes locally on Python 3.13.12.

## Background Automation State

The implementation follows `docs/BACKGROUND_SEARCH_AUTOMATION_BLUEPRINT.md`:

- Single bounded command: `exo background-run-once`
- Top-level SQLite logs under `logs/`
- Top-level config under `configs/`
- Known TESS fixtures plus synthetic edge cases
- Composite target priority with exposed component factors and reason codes
- Exactly-one primary outcome target: reviewed or needs-follow-up
- Mandatory follow-up test records for escalated targets
- Conservative draft reports exported as Markdown and HTML
- Ranked top-three submission recommendations
- Explicit human-approval records; no external submission command is implemented
- Scheduler-friendly exit codes behind `--scheduler-exit-codes`
- Non-overlap locking with a brief wait

Runtime artifacts remain ignored by default:

```text
logs/background_search.sqlite3
reports/background/*.md
reports/background/*.html
```

## Blocked

**Production ML Tier 2 — checkpoint generalization**

- The label gate is open with 2,623 usable balanced TESS snippets.
- The first seed-42 checkpoint completed training but was rejected on 2026-06-10.
- Held-out test AUC was 0.7404 and calibrated F1 was 0.6297, below the documented 0.85 and 0.80 targets.
- Validation-fitted Platt calibration worsened test Brier score and ECE, so no calibration or checkpoint artifact was promoted into `models/`.
- Architecture and evaluation details: `docs/CNN_SPEC.md`.
- Next implementation blocker: improve the training recipe without tuning against the opened test partition, then retrain and evaluate a new candidate.

## Next Actions

1. Run `python Skills/tier2_progress_reporter.py --labels data/exofop_ctoi_labels.json --output reports/tier2_status.md --json-output reports/tier2_status.json` to produce offline CNN readiness artifacts.
2. Run `python Skills/count_tess_labels.py` only when live ExoFOP access is intentionally approved, then run `python Skills/tess_label_check_summary.py` to inspect the local SQLite audit history.
3. Improve and rerun the CNN training pipeline; do not promote the rejected seed-42 checkpoint documented in `docs/CNN_SPEC.md`.
4. Use `toi_checker.py` before investing pipeline time on new live targets.
5. Use `batch_scan.py` + `alert_filter.py` + `rank_candidates.py` + `watchlist.py` for systematic follow-up.
6. Use `multi_sector_phase_compare.py` to inspect sector-to-sector depth and phase consistency before advancing multi-sector follow-up targets.
7. Use `candidate_dashboard_export.py` to build static local review dashboards from existing candidate JSON outputs, including optional phase-fold plot artifact paths when available.
8. Use `candidate_api.py` to serve existing local candidate JSON, optional read-only background SQLite summaries, `/artifact.json` review bundles, and opt-in CORS for separate local frontends.
9. Use `candidate_browser_ui.py` for an interactive local browser UI with embedded-data/API modes and optional phase-fold plot previews.
10. Keep CTOI/community candidate ingestion opt-in and outside default training; the fixture-backed source contract now lives in `docs/CTOI_SOURCE_CONTRACT.md`.

Live-network note: the CNN gate check was not run during the latest local
maintenance pass because it queries ExoFOP and requires intentional live network
approval.

Remote sync note: local `main` is synced with `origin/main` as of the latest
handoff.

## Key Design Decisions In Effect

- Bayesian log-score model is default; XGBoost and ensemble are opt-in.
- `OptScore = float | None`: missing diagnostics contribute neutrally to log scores.
- Missing diagnostics fail threshold gates conservatively.
- Conservative priors keep false positives prominent; mission-specific prior profiles are opt-in through `configs/scoring_priors_v0.json`.
- `provenance_score` is computed from cadence, sector count, and pipeline quality.
- `toi_checker.py` should be consulted before investing pipeline time on any new target.
- Default tests must mock external services; live tests require `integration_live`.
- Never output "confirmed planet"; use "candidate signal" or "follow-up target".
- Background automation uses SQLite for durable state and deterministic fixtures by default.
- Background automation obeys the human-approval gate; no external submission without review.
